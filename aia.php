                    Elements of the Periodic Table.  Building upon 
                    fast Periodic Table reciting, suggest further formal 
                    training, like typingclub.com, free 2-hr classes 
                    (Excel I and II; Word I and II; HTML/CSS; 3D Printing; 
                    Google Maps; Google Drive; typing, OTHER THINGS) at 
                    Downtown Seattle Central Public Library, and 
                    SCC-Computer Programming via WorkSource/other funding.
                </li>
			    <li> Second, in terms of what has been done, first start out 
                    with client's recent history of homeless.  Then, 
                    showcase RANTs opinions portfolio.
                </li>
			    <li> Third, in terms of of must client costs, see section 
                    below for MONEY and donations.
                </li>
			    <li> Fourth, client does reside and work in the Seattle 
                    Queen Anne/Lake Union area.  Can do ONE-country outlining 
                    work travel.  However, all other long work travels 
                    would have to be facilitated remotely or cost-up-front 
                    negotiated travel expenses.
                </li>
			    <li> Contact thru the CONTACT-LINK-BUTTON with 
                    e-mail link, may/may not have personal phone 
                    number.  Really trying push client for new, 
                    cheap business phone number line.
                </li>
			    <li> References will be available up request.  Portfolios 
                    of art will be in website galley.  In addition, 
                    bona vides and proof-pictures of client artwork

                        tracing paper-like art-pad of paper.  Then, push goal 
                        of have artist do one tracing per day or per week of 
                        favorite comic strip, comic book cover, comic book 
                        movie poster, non-comic movie posters, non-comic-books,

                    </li>
                    <li> Suggest Downtown Central Libary for information

                        With Art for further formal charity/non-profit

                        Path With Art as formal evaluator of artwork.  
                        With some suggestive actions, PWA should be 
                        able to steer artist into having art viewed 
                        publicly with 90 days as realistic goal.

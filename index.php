            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  My interests are about MAXIMUM ROI for . . .  ME.  </p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Meaning, I do NOT like to mess around with [I]nvestments of TIME and ENERGY & finite RESOURCES to obtain [R]eturn [O]f said [I]investments.</p>
            <br>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Now, to clarify, the RETURN is very few times MONEY.  RETURN for me MEANS get stuff done that helps me and world around me out.</p>
            <br>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Remember folks, the ECOMONY of LIFE from my point of view is:</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  10 units of finite [T]IME</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;   5 units of finite [H]UMAN [E]NERGY/CREATIVITY and finite RESOURCES </p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;   1 units of finite [M]ONEY</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  (with a sprikling of LUCK if there PROPER PLANNING and EXECUTION with respect to T.HE.M listed above)</p>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The type of web development I prefer: Project management, programmer, server administrator, etc.  Basically the BACK-END stuff.  My goal is to only work with FIXED WIDTH FONTs in HTML and JavaScript and have EMPTY CSS baby.  Stream-lined Hemingway-Style.  </p>
